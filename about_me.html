								<h3>Tata Consultancy Services – Jersey City, NJ</h3>
								<p><strong>Data Engineer, Client: Kenvue</strong> | Mar 2022 – Present</p>
								<ul>
								<p>At Kenvue, I led the end-to-end development of scalable data engineering solutions using Azure Data Factory and Databricks. The goal was to streamline supply chain data ingestion and real-time transformation. By designing automated pipelines and implementing Delta Live Tables, I significantly improved data processing efficiency, reduced manual effort, and enhanced overall data quality. These solutions empowered stakeholders with timely, accurate supply chain insights and helped optimize operational decision-making.</p>

								<p><strong>Data Analyst, Client: Johnson & Johnson</strong></p>
								<ul>
								<p>At Johnson & Johnson, I focused on analyzing large financial datasets extracted from SAP HANA and transforming them into actionable insights. Using SQL and Tableau, I developed interactive dashboards and resolved reporting inconsistencies through rigorous validation and troubleshooting. This work improved the accuracy of financial reporting, reduced turnaround time for analysis, and provided leadership with reliable data to support strategic financial planning and forecasting.</p>
